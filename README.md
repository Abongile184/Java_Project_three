# Java_Project_three
Hospital App project, this was an end of the year project that i made 
it does need some code reviewing as some of the logic within the code does not make sense 
it consists of a registration form where a user registeres the patients information
then a second form where the patient selects the medicine they need then the sub total and total are tallied 
information is not captured on any database or text file, i still need to revise this code again
